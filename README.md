# Covid-19-Analysis
Repository that contains the analysis performed over a mexican database of people affected by glaucoma. The analysis is focused on determine the risk factors linked to death related to covid. Tasks performed include data cleaning, normalization, standarization and codification, resampling, data visualization and model training.

The project includes historical data from pandemic beginnings, from January to June 2020. The database used contains around 263000 cases in all Mexico. This database was collected with a centinel model. This model consisted in sampling the 10% of the patients that presented a viral-respiratory diagnosis for COVID-19. It comprehends the information reported by 475 hospitals, named USMER (Monitorization Units of Viral Respiratory Illnesses). The USMER were located all around the country, and comprehended all the health insurance or services given by the government (IMSS, ISSSTE, SEDENA, SEMAR). The database used is available in Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marianarfranklin/mexico-positive-covid-19-cases-prediction). Data was accessed and stored in a csv file. It contained information on previous existing illnesses, age, sex, ambulatory patient, if the patient arrived UCI, and others. In total, in the database there exists 41 attributes.

The centinel model used for integrating the data was a process performed thanks to 'Secretaría de Salud'. The selected hospitals were because it was determined they are representative of all mexican population. The distribution of those units can be appreciated in the next image. For more details, refer to the [oficial page](https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/informacion-internacional-y-nacional-sobre-nuevo-coronavirus-2019-ncov). In the data, the attribute 'RESULTADO' with value 1, means a positive PCR and 2 a negative one. The data do not contain sensitive information, and it is free to the public to use.

## Database Preprocessing
We performed a recodification to the flags defined in the original database. We detected null or inconsistent data, and eliminated them, achieving total cases of 260372. We also coded a variable for the death people, from the death date given, that was the only reference to someone's death. Age groups were also defined to mantain some groups of interest. The ranges for the groups were 0-15 (children), 15-25 (youths), 25-50 (adults), middle-aged (50-65) and elder (65+). New features were also added (quantity of previous illness and quantity of risk factors) during the analysis. Risk factors comprehended pregnancy, immunosuppressed and smoker.

There existed a huge proportion in the original database between the death and survived ones. The survivors were around the 98% of the total database. As we also intended to develop a classification model (this would be understood later), we explored both subsampling (Near Miss technique) and oversampling (SMOTE technique). The following image shows the distributions of the age feature with Near Miss and SMOTE applied. With near miss, we subsampled the survivors class from 255,962 to 22050 samples (approx, 8.6%), and with SMOTE we performed oversampling of the minority class from 4410 to achieve 17640 samples (approx. the 400%).

To determine if the sampling techniques were able to retain unaltered the data distribution, we analyzed the age distributions in both methods and compared statistical values and measurements. The next table illustrates those results, showing that the distributions remain unchanged. We also performed statistical proofs (Kolmogorov Smirnov, K-S) for a significance level of 5% to ensure to not alterate the original data distribution. Wassterstein distance was also measured for this comparison purposes and in the same table the information of those results is provided.

After the transformations to overcome class imbalance, we performed exploratory data analysis. All the variables except age were categorical, in particular, binary. A huge and continuous increment during march-april 2020 (when covid became pandemic and started to spread across the world) was noticed as stated in the next image. There was also observed the states with more mortality, and we showed a graph containing the states that surpassed the national average of deaths in general. This information is also shown. During the exploratory analysis, smoking was the risk factor more present in the death ones, and neumonia, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity were the primary conditions that were more common in dead patients. In general, most patients were ambulatory in the hospitals, even with the oversampling of the minority class, and a small fraction of both survivals and dead ones were intubated.
